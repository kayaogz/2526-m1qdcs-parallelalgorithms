# [M1 QDCS] Parallel algorithms (2.5 ECTS)

This is an introductory course on the basics of the design and analysis of parallel algorithms.

# Course organization

We will have seven sessions of 3 hours each (plus mini-exam, c.f. below). The first session is an introduction to algorithms, complexity, and PRAM model. The rest will be a mix of course (around 1h-1h30) and problem solving session (around 1h30-2h) on that subject.

You need to add your information to the course grade sheet by the end of the second session of the course:

Afterwards, you will not be able to see or edit the file. This is the mailing list I will use for course announcements.

We will mostly follow the relevant chapters from the book "Parallel Algorithms" by Casanova, Robert:

## Session 1: Review of sequential algorithms, complexity analysis, RAM model, and introduction to PRAM.
## Session 2: PRAM (II)
## Session 3: PRAM (III)
## Session 4: Communication networks (I) / Miniexam-1 (PRAM)
## Session 5: Communication networks (II) / Miniexam-2 (PRAM)
## Session 6: Algorithms on communication networks (I) / Miniexam-3 (Comm networks)
## Session 7: Algorithms on communication networks (II) / Miniexam-4 (Algorithms on comm networks)

# Evaluation

## End-of-session mini-exams
At the end of weeks 4, 5, 6, 7, there will be written mini-exams of 25-30 minutes, giving 5/20 points each. The exercises will be in a similar format to what we solve in the problem solving sessions (algorithm design + complexity analysis).

You can bring **four** A4 sheets (so you have eight pages in double-sided) containing your notes to the mini-exam; no other material is allowed.
